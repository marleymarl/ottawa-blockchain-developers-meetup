# ottawa-blockchain-developers-meetup
This Meetup is targeted at developers who want to live code blockchain and decentralized applications. This is not a meetup to discuss concepts and business plans, it is to get into the nitty-gritty of coding applications. This is the repo for code and instructions prior to and post each meetup.
