# Meetup #1: Ethereum Solidity vs Hyperledger Chaincode - a live coding session

Enterprises are actively evaluating whether to use Ethereum or Hyperledger or a combination thereof for some key use cases. In this meetup [Greg Marlin]('https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-marlin-8a4528a/') will live code smart contracts in Ethereum Solidity and Hyperledger Chaincode for a key use case (trading derivatives) and we can discuss the pros and cons of each.

## Requirements

```
1. [Git]('https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03')
2. [Node JS]('https://nodejs.org/en/')
3. Docker: [Windows Install]('https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/') / [Mac Install]('https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/')


```

## Use Case Instructions

The use case we will be using as a basis for the smart contracts is that of trading derivatives - specifically [Credit Default Swaps]('https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp'), as seen in [The Big Short]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-7HA9_qmdg'. )
